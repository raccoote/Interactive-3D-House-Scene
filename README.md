# 3D House Scene with OpenGL in C

This C code creates an engaging 3D scene of a house using the OpenGL library. The program features a rotating sun casting dynamic shadows on the rendered house, while the camera provides a customizable view of the scene. The code employs GLUT to implement a right-click menu, allowing users to toggle between different rendering options, such as adjusting polygon detail and enabling or disabling a spotlight effect. The house is constructed using OpenGL primitives like rectangles and triangles, forming the walls and roof. The sun is represented as a dynamic sphere, with its position and color changing over time. Lighting effects, including the sun's diffuse color and the spotlight's position and cutoff, contribute to the realism of the scene. The camera's perspective is controlled by user inputs, enhancing the interactive nature of the program. Overall, this code offers an insightful exploration of graphics programming using OpenGL in C, combining rendering techniques, lighting effects, and user interaction to create an immersive 3D experience.

When running the .exe, make sure the freeglut.dll is in the same folder.
